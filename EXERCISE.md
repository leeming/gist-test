Submission guidelines
# Do

Provide a README file in text or markdown format that provides a concise way to setup and run the provided solution.

Take the time to read any applicable API or service docs, it may save you significant effort

Make your solution simple and clear. We aren't looking for overly complex ways to solve the problem since in our experience simple, clear solutions to problems are also generally the most maintainable and extensible solutions.

 Provide your solution in a zip or compressed tar archive.

 
# Don't

Expect the reviewer to dedicate a machine for the purpose of reviewing the test by

    Installing software globally that may conflict with system software
    Requiring changes to system wide configurations

Provide overly complex solutions that need to spin up a ton of unneeded supporting dependencies. We aspire to keeping our dev experiences as simple as possible (but no simpler)!

Include identifying information in your submission. We are endeavouring to make our review process anonymous.
 

# Github API

Write a script that uses the Github API to query a user’s publicly available gists. When the script is first run, it should display a listing of all the user’s publicly available gists. On subsequent runs the script should list any gists that have been published since the last run. The script may optionally provide other functionality (possibly via additional command line flags) but the above functionality must be implemented.
